## Testing

The project includes several testing utilities:

```bash
# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with UI
pnpm test:ui

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

## Component Development

We use Storybook for component development and testing:

```bash
# Start Storybook
pnpm storybook   # Available at http://localhost:6006

# Build Storybook
pnpm build-storybook
```

## Documentation

To work on the documentation locally:

```bash
# Start documentation site
pnpm docs:dev    # Available at http://localhost:3004

# Build documentation
pnpm docs:build

# Check for broken links
pnpm docs:lint
```

## Code Quality

The project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

- **ESLint**: For code linting
- **simple-git-hooks**: For pre-commit checks
- **lint-staged**: For running linters on staged files
- **commitlint**: For commit message conventions

```bash
# Fix linting issues
pnpm lint:fix
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't run the development script">
    If you're having trouble running the development script:
    1. Make sure you have installed the project dependencies using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
    2. Make sure you have set up the environment variables correctly
    <Warning>
    Sometimes environment variables will change because the project is still under development and not yet stable.
    This requires you to manually compare the variables in the sample file with those actually used. We are very sorry for the inconvenience.
    </Warning>
